## 📖 About

**Museo** is an Android application that allows users to explore and discover artworks from two major museum and art gallery APIs. 
With Museo, users can browse curated collections, search for specific artworks or artists, and learn more about the rich world of visual art — all from the convenience of their mobile device. 
The app features a clean, intuitive interface designed to make art discovery easy and enjoyable.

The app relies on a custom backend service, developed alongside the frontend, which is essential for aggregating and managing data from the two external APIs.
